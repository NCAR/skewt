	/**
	* SkewTAdapter provides a pure virtual interface between the generic SkewT class and a given 
	* graphics rendering component. SkewTAdapter is subclassed for each type of graphics component.
	* For instance, SkewTAdapterPesgo provides the implmentation for displaying SkewT in a
	* GigaSoft ProEssentials graphics component. Similarly, SkewTAdapterQt allows SkewT to render 
	* via a Qt QWidget.
	*
	* The list of member functions is somewhat bloated, but not all of them need to provide functionality. For instance, 
	* if savePlot() is not needed, the derived class function could be a noop. 
	*
	* In usage, a SkewTAdapter is created first, and this is provided to the constructor of the SkewT. Thus,
	* the SkewT does not know what kind of graphics component is being utilized.
	*
	* All coordinates in this interface reference a virtual drawing space 0 <= x <= 1, 0 <= y <= 1. The SkewTAdapter 
	* derived classes are responsible for comverting these values to actuall drawing coordinates.
	* 
	* It is legitimate for derived classes to add their own member functions which are specific to the graphics
	* component. These functions would then be accessed through the adapter, since SkewT will not be aware of them.
	*
	* Note that the SkewT class has two operational modes. Its constructor can be called with arrays of data to be
	* initially plotted; this is the normal static mode of operation. However, member functions are provided that allow data to 
	* be incrementally added, as in a real-time display. (See SkewT::drawTdry(), SkewT::drawDp() and SkewT::drawWind()).
