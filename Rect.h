	/**
	* Rect implements a virtual rectangle on the drawing page. 
	* The drawing page area is specified by boundaries 
	* in the range 0 and 1. Likewise, reference to locations
	* within the Rect are specified by coordinates in the range 0 to 1. 
	*
	* Rect is a virtual drawing class; it calls a SkewTAdapter to
	* actually render the drawing on a particular graphics component.
	*
	* Primatives are provided for drawing lines, symbols and text.
	* Lines can be automatically clipped to fall within the rectangle.
	* The clipping algorithm is really cool.
	*
	* Rect distinguishes drawing temperature and dewpoint data points
	* from the other graphic primitives, so that these requests can be passed
	* on and managed by the SkewTAdapter.
	*
	* Rect can be asked to save the endpoints of a clipped line, and provide them
	* so that labelling can be positioned in relation to the actually drawn line.
	*
	* <h3>The Clipping Algorithm</h3>
	* The clipping algorithm is assisted by the outcode class. Rect::outcode 
	* relates a point to the Rect, and can idicate whether a point is inside or outside of the Rect. If outside, 
	* Rect::outcode knows which boundary or boundaries the point is adjacent to.
	* 
	* To clip a line so that it is constrained within the Rect, the algorithm proceeds as follows:
	* <ul>
	* <li> If both endpoints of the line are outside of the Rect, and adjacent to the same boundary,
	* the line does not intersect the Rect.
	* <li> If both endpoints are within the Rect, the line does not need to be clipped.
	* <li> At this point, it is established that either: a) one endpoint is within the Rect, and one endpoint is outside, or
	* b) Both endpoints are outside of the boundary, and the line crosses the Rect. Iterate around the four sides of the 
	* Rect, looking for the intersection of the boundary and the line. Clip the line at these intersections. This is repeated 
	* a second time, for the new line, so that the possible second intersection is clipped.
	* </ul>
